/usr/sbin/xen-list is a C-based program that uses libxc directly to list
running domains.  It provides better performance than 'xm list' since
it runs natively and avoids xend locking.

/usr/sbin/xen-destory is an alternative for 'xm destroy'.  It will forcibly
destroy a domain even in cases where 'xm destroy' will not.  xen-destroy is
useful for tools such as HAE Xen Agent.

/usr/sbin/xen-vmresync is a executable python script. It can be used by PSO
to resync VM status.
