Basic building for the latest (supported) -unstable hypervisor is
pretty simple:

$ make

The resulting xenalyze binary can be used as described in the
xenalyze.html documentation.

If you want to build for an earlier version of the hypervisor, you
must apply the patches in the back-patches directory.  Look for the
TARGETS file in that directory for the sequence of patches to apply
for each target.

If you just want to build, applying them with patch -p1 < filename in
order will suffice.

If you want to do any development / bux fixing, you should use
mercurial queues:
 $ hg qimport back-patches/file1
 $ hg qpush
 $ hg qimport back-patches/file2
 $ hg qpush
   ...

Make sure that you qpush between qimports, or the order of the patches
will be reversed (LIFO).

If you do submit a patch, make sure to keep changes to back-patches
separate from changes to the core file.  E.g., if you apply patches
and develop a new xenalyze feature, use hg diff (or a "working"
mercurial patch on the top) to separate the new feature from the
backport patches.  Pop all the back-patches, apply the new-feature
patch, and commit.  Then qpush one at a time and build, to make sure
that no changes need to be made to the back-patches.

This is a bit of a hassle, but I think there's a good reason for it.
The file format for a given release is fixed at the time of release.
But the kinds of analysis that might want to be done generally develop
*after* that release.  Rather than limit new functionality to new
releases, or maintain separate branches, we maintain back-patches that
just change information related to the file format differences.
